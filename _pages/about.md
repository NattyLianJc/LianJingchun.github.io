I am second-year master's student at the School of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, specializing in **deep learning**, **multimodal learning**, and **image recognition**. My primary research interests focus on leveraging deep learning techniques to process and integrate multimodal data to enhance performance in image analysis and recognition tasks.

I am dedicated to exploring the applications of deep learning in image processing, particularly in the field of multimodal data fusion, where I study how to efficiently combine information from different sources (such as images and text) to improve the accuracy and robustness of models.

Throughout my research, I have participated in several projects related to **image recognition** and **multimodal data analysis**, applying deep learning techniques to solve real-world challenges and gaining extensive experience in the field.

If you are interested in my research or potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to contact me.
